🏆 **Built for Krackathon & GodamSahur** - Category: Best Practical Use

## 🌙 About GodamSahur

EduLaluan was built for [**GodamSahur**](https://sahur.dev/) - a virtual hackathon running throughout Ramadan 1447H organized by [Amanz Media](https://amanz.my).

**GodamSahur** combines "Godam" (forge/hammer) + "Sahur" (pre-dawn meal), encouraging participants to spend **one hour daily after sahur** building ideas or projects they've wanted to create. The mission is to:

- Encourage developers to build projects during Ramadan with manageable daily commitment (1 hour/day)
- Foster creation of projects that **help the community**
- Promote building in public and sharing progress with others

Projects span categories like:
- **Kewangan** - Muslim-friendly personal finance tools
- **Mini SaaS** - Simple platforms solving community problems
- **Sosial** - Social impact projects
- **API Integration** - Building on existing platforms

💰 **RM10,000 in prizes** sponsored by Amanz, split among all MVP completers.
