The university operates global campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. Acceptance rate is approximately 13%. Notable alumni include multiple Nobel laureates, Academy Award winners, and business leaders. Malaysian students have strong representation across programs, particularly in business and arts. Graduates benefit from extensive NYC networking and career opportunities.",
